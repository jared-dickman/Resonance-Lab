Repertoire section
- optimize for showing songs you know, with chords/progressions/album info/youtube track
- app can then pick from this list for the generated practice session, or suggest similar songs


Structured Generated Practice Session
- have the ai respond with a json structure that defines the next practice session
- given this structure, can plug into the SavePracticeSession form
- and create a new form with a checkbox/strikethrough once a section is complete
- timer/metronome auto set for each section


congrats messages for finishing a lesson [ai generated of course]
posture and dynamics reminder [popups] appear during the lesson
20 seconds of rest (close your eyes / visualize) between tasks


upload/record audio/video along with a practice session
review/rewatch these
have the ai analyze/break up this data

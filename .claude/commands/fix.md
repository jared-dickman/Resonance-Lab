---

$ARGUMENTS

Fix issues systematically:

1. **Read the error** - Get exact file:line location
2. **Understand the rule** - Check rule documentation
3. **Apply the fix** - Follow project patterns
4. **Verify** - Run checks to confirm resolution

**Common fixes:**

- TanStack violations → Use feature hooks
- Type errors → Add proper types (never `as any`)
- Animation issues → Use constants
- API routes → Add Zod validation

Report what was fixed and verification results.

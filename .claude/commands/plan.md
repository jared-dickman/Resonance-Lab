# Next.js 15 TypeScript React — Implementation Plan Prompt (LLM-optimized)

Purpose: produce precise, actionable implementation plans for TypeScript React apps using Next.js 15. Be skeptical,
thorough, and collaborative. Deliver production-grade specs.

## Invocation

- If parameters include file paths or a ticket:
  - Read all provided files fully.
  - Start analysis immediately.

- If no parameters:
  - Ask:
    1. Task/ticket description (or file)
    2. Repo access or paths to relevant files
    3. Constraints (performance, SEO, security, deadlines)
    4. Dependencies, prior art, design mocks, research links

Then wait for input.

## Process

1. Intake and codebase scan
   - Read fully: package.json, next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc._, .prettierrc._, app/, components/, lib/,
     hooks/, public/, middleware.ts, app/api/\*\*/route.ts, error.tsx, not-found.tsx, loading.tsx, env files, tests/,
     e2e/.
   - Note: router, Server vs Client Components, Server Actions, Route Handlers, Middleware, runtime (node/edge),
     caching and revalidation, data-fetching patterns, auth, feature flags, env usage, CI commands, testing setup.
   - Analyze llm directory for project rules and context.

2. Cross-check requirements
   - Map requirements to current code.
   - Identify gaps, risks, and constraints.
   - List assumptions that need confirmation.

3. Clarify
   - Provide a concise understanding summary.
   - Ask only questions that cannot be answered from code.
   - Propose success metrics and constraints if missing.

4. Design options
   - Offer 1–2 viable approaches with clear pros/cons.
   - Call out RSC boundaries, caching, runtime, and DX tradeoffs.

5. Plan outline
   - Propose phases and sequencing.
   - Get confirmation before writing details.

6. Detailed plan
   - Write a complete, testable plan (see template).
   - Include code paths, snippet stubs, commands, and verification.

7. Review and iterate
   - Present the plan file path.
   - Apply feedback and finalize. No open questions remain.

# [Feature/Task] — Implementation Plan (Next.js 15, TypeScript)

## Overview

[What and why in 2–3 sentences]

## Current State

- Stack summary: Next.js 15 (App Router), TS strict, SSR/SSG, Server Actions used? Auth? DB?
- Relevant files and patterns:
  - `app/...`
  - `components/...`
  - `app/api/.../route.ts`
  - `middleware.ts`
  - `next.config.ts`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - Tests present: [unit, component, e2e]

## Desired End State

- Functional behavior
- API contracts
- RSC boundary expectations (server/client)
- Caching/revalidation strategy
- Performance, a11y, SEO targets
- Verification approach

## Key Findings

- [file:line] [important constraint]
- [file:line] [pattern to follow]
- [file:line] [risk/edge case]

## Out of Scope

- [Explicit non-goals]

## Implementation Approach

- High-level strategy and rationale
- Data flow and component architecture
- Runtime (edge/node) and security considerations
- Migration/rollback plan (if any)

## Phases

### Phase 1 — [Name]

- Goal
- Changes
  - File: `app/...`
    - Changes: [summary]
    - Code:

```ts
// snippet or signature stub
```

- File: `components/...`
  - Changes: [summary]
- RSC boundaries: [server/client]
- Caching/revalidation: [none | time | tag | pathway]
- Security: [input validation, secrets, auth]
- Observability: [logs/metrics]
- Success Criteria
  - Automated
    - [ ] Typecheck: `<pkg> run typecheck`
    - [ ] Lint: `<pkg> run lint`
    - [ ] Unit tests: `<pkg> test`
    - [ ] Build: `<pkg> run build`
    - [ ] E2E: `<pkg> run e2e`
  - Manual
    - [ ] User flow works
    - [ ] A11y passes (keyboard, landmarks, labels)
    - [ ] Mobile + desktop
    - [ ] No regressions in related routes

### Phase 2 — [Name]

[Repeat structure]

## Testing Strategy

- Unit: [what and edge cases]
- Component (RTL): [what, RSC boundaries]
- Integration/API: [route handlers, server actions]
- E2E (Playwright/Cypress): [scenarios]
- Fixtures and mocking guidelines (fetch, cookies, headers)

## Performance

- RSC-first; minimize client JS
- dynamic import() and route-level splitting where needed
- Image optimization, metadata, streaming/Suspense
- Avoid re-renders; memoization where justified
- Verify bundle size and TTFB/LCP targets

## Security & Privacy

- Server-only secrets; never in client
- Input validation (e.g., zod) at boundaries
- Auth/session checks in Server Actions/Route Handlers
- CSRF strategy (if forms)
- Headers and CSP (if applicable)

## SEO

- metadata.ts, canonical, robots, sitemaps
- Structured data (JSON-LD) if relevant
- Clean URLs and not-found/error handling

## Migration Notes

- Data changes (e.g., Prisma migrations)
- Backfill/rollback strategy
- Feature flag rollout (if used)

## References

- Ticket: [link or path]
- Design: [link]
- Related code: `path/to/file.tsx`
````

Note: use the project’s package manager (npm | pnpm | yarn | bun). Detect from lockfile.

## Next.js-Specific Guidelines

- App Router first. Use Server Components by default; add "use client" only when required.
- Prefer Server Actions and Route Handlers for mutations and API. Keep secrets server-side.
- Choose runtime per route (edge/node). Don’t use unsupported APIs on edge.
- Define caching explicitly: fetch cache, revalidate time/tag, dynamic rendering when needed.
- Use error.tsx, not-found.tsx, and loading.tsx for UX and resilience.
- Centralize env access and validation. Do not expose server-only envs to the client.
- Keep strict TypeScript. Narrow types with guards. Validate external input (zod or similar).
- Follow existing folder and component patterns. Reuse primitives and hooks.

## Interaction Rules

- Be precise. No guesses. Verify in code.
- Ask targeted questions only when code cannot answer them.
- Include file:line references when available.
- Provide copy-paste commands and code.
- Keep changes incremental and testable.
- Do not finalize with open questions.

## Success Criteria (format)

- Automated
  - [ ] Typecheck: `<pkg> run typecheck`
  - [ ] Lint: `<pkg> run lint`
  - [ ] Unit/component tests: `<pkg> test`
  - [ ] E2E: `<pkg> run e2e`
  - [ ] Build: `<pkg> run build` passes with no warnings that block CI
- Manual
  - [ ] Core UX flows verified
  - [ ] A11y: keyboard, contrast, labels
  - [ ] Mobile + desktop
  - [ ] SEO checks (metadata, canonical, sitemap if relevant)
  - [ ] Performance acceptable under realistic load

## Common Patterns

- New UI feature: server-first data, minimal client state, colocate components, dynamic import when heavy.
- Form with mutation: Server Action or POST route handler; validate input; optimistic UI (optional); error boundaries.
- Data fetching: fetch on server with correct cache policy; tag revalidation for mutations.
- API design: Route Handlers with typed input/output; consistent errors; auth checks.
- Auth: session checks in server boundaries; avoid client secrets; secure cookies.
- DB change: define migrations (e.g., Prisma), update data access, update server code, backfill, test.

## Subtasks

- Split research tasks by domain (routing, data, UI, tests).
- Specify directories, questions, and expected outputs.
- Wait for all findings, then synthesize.
- If results conflict, verify directly in code and correct.

## Example Opening (no parameters)

I will create a detailed Next.js 15 TS plan. Please provide:

1. Ticket or task description (or file)
2. Repo access or relevant file paths
3. Constraints (perf, SEO, security, deadline)
4. Links to designs, prior art, or research

I’ll analyze the codebase, propose options, and deliver a phased, verifiable plan.

description: Initialize an isolated git worktree session for safe experimentation with guaranteed work preservation

## Worktree Workflow Command

You are managing a git worktree session. A **worktree** creates a separate physical directory linked to the same git repository, allowing isolated work on a separate branch while keeping the main directory clean.

### Startup Sequence

1. **Derive descriptive session name:**
   - Analyze the user's task/feature request
   - Create a short, kebab-case name (1-3 words) describing the feature
   - Examples:
     - "Add user management" ‚Üí `user-management`
     - "Fix authentication bug" ‚Üí `auth-fix`
     - "Update navbar styling" ‚Üí `navbar-styling`
     - "Implement search feature" ‚Üí `search-feature`

2. **Create named worktree:**

   ```bash
   SESSION_NAME="feature-name"  # Replace with descriptive name
   git worktree add ../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME} -b session/${SESSION_NAME}
   ```

3. **Explain to user:**
   - Worktree created at: `../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME}`
   - Branch: `session/${SESSION_NAME}`
   - All changes happen in worktree directory
   - Main directory stays on `master` branch
   - Git history is shared between both directories

4. **Verify and navigate:**

   ```bash
   git worktree list  # Confirm creation
   cd ../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME}
   ```

5. **Store worktree info for session:**
   - Remember the worktree path
   - Remember the session branch name
   - Use TodoWrite to track all work

### During Session

**All operations happen in the worktree directory:**

- File edits: Use worktree path for all Read/Write/Edit tools
- Commits: Go to session branch automatically
- **Commits: Make atomic commits frequently** (after each logical chunk, see Best Practices section below)
- Progress: Track with TodoWrite tool
- Remind user: "Working in worktree session branch"

### Best Practices During Active Work

#### 1. Atomic Commits Are Mandatory

Commit after each logical chunk of work. Never accumulate uncommitted changes across multiple tasks.

Examples: "update empty states", "improve error messages", "add form placeholders"

#### 2. Why This Matters

**‚ö†Ô∏è If a worktree directory is removed while uncommitted changes exist, ALL WORK IS LOST.**

Worktrees are temporary folders. Commits are permanent. Only committed work is safe.

Real scenario:

```
‚úó Agent works 2 hours, makes 45+ changes, never commits
‚úó Worktree directory disappears ‚Üí all work lost
```

Don't rely on exit protocol as your only save point.

#### 3. When to Commit

Commit at any trigger (whichever comes first):

- After completing each todo item
- After modifying 3-5 related files
- Before switching to different work type
- **Minimum: Every 7 minutes**

If in doubt, commit.

#### 4. Commit Message Format

```bash
# ‚úì Good:
git commit -m "feat: update app tagline for clarity"
git commit -m "feat: improve empty states across Ideas, Keywords, Blog pages"
git commit -m "fix: resolve TypeScript error in BlogDetailPage"

# ‚úó Bad:
git commit -m "update copy"  # Too vague
git commit -m "wip"  # Not descriptive
```

Use format: `type: what you changed`
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`

#### 5. Example Workflow

```bash
# Start session for "copy improvements" feature
SESSION_NAME="copy-improvements"
git worktree add ../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME} -b session/${SESSION_NAME}
cd ../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME}

# Edit ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Commit (repeat)
git add app/config/constants.ts
git commit -m "feat: update app tagline"

git add app/components/ideas/IdeasPage.tsx
git commit -m "feat: improve Ideas page empty states"

git add app/components/keywords/KeywordsPage.tsx
git commit -m "feat: improve Keywords page copy"

# Exit: merge all commits
git checkout master
git merge session/${SESSION_NAME}
git worktree remove ../BlogzillaV5-session-${SESSION_NAME}
git branch -d session/${SESSION_NAME}
```

Result: 3+ save points instead of 0.

#### 6. Quick Reference

```bash
git status                          # Check what needs committing
git add -A                          # Stage all changes
git commit -m "feat: description"   # Commit
git log --oneline -10               # View commit history
```

#### 7. Warning Signs - Commit Immediately If:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 20+ file changes without a commit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't remember what you changed an hour ago
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 10+ completed todos with no commits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 30+ minutes with no commits

**Action:** STOP ‚Üí `git add -A` ‚Üí `git commit -m "feat: what you did"` ‚Üí CONTINUE

#### 8. Key Insight

```
Worktree = temporary folder (can disappear)
Commits = permanent (always safe)
```

Uncommitted work is one filesystem error away from vanishing. Only committed work survives.

### Session Exit Protocol

**üö® NEVER MERGE TO MASTER OR PUSH - USER MUST REVIEW FIRST**

When done:

1. **Commit remaining changes:**

   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "feat: [description]"
   ```

2. **Run quality checks:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run typecheck  # Check types
   pnpm exec ast-grep scan  # Check violations
   ```

3. **Start dev server on random port:**

   ```bash
   PORT=$(node -e "require('http').createServer().listen(0, function() { console.log(this.address().port); this.close(); })")
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MSW=true PORT=$PORT pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Present summary:**

   ```
   ‚úÖ Session complete - Review & test before merging!

   üì¶ Branch: session/${SESSION_NAME}
   üéØ Commits: [count] commits

   üåê Dev server: http://localhost:[PORT]

   ‚úÖ TypeScript: passing
   ‚úÖ ast-grep: no violations

   üß™ Test your changes, then merge manually:
      git merge session/${SESSION_NAME}
      git push origin master
   ```

**NEVER auto-execute:** `git merge`, `git push`, or cleanup commands

### Session State Tracking

Store in memory throughout session:

- `WORKTREE_PATH`: Full path to worktree directory (e.g., `../BlogzillaV5-session-user-management`)
- `SESSION_BRANCH`: Branch name (e.g., `session/user-management`)
- `SESSION_NAME`: Descriptive name (e.g., `user-management`)
- `SESSION_ACTIVE`: Boolean flag
- `CHANGES_COMMITTED`: Boolean flag

Update these as work progresses. Check before allowing session end.

### Error Handling

**If worktree creation fails:**

- Check for existing worktrees: `git worktree list`
- Check for branch conflicts: `git branch -a`
- Suggest cleanup: `git worktree prune`

**If merge conflicts occur:**

- Show conflict files
- Guide user through resolution
- Don't auto-merge without confirmation

**If user tries to exit prematurely:**

- Show clear warning
- List uncommitted files
- Require explicit choice
- Never assume "discard"

### Success Criteria

‚úì User understands worktree concept
‚úì All file operations use worktree path
‚úì Work is never lost due to premature exit
‚úì Clear status updates throughout session
‚úì Clean worktree removal after save
‚úì No orphaned worktrees or branches

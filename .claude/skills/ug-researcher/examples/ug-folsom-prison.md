[Intro]
G

[Verse 1]
  G
I hear the train a comin', it's rollin' round the bend
                                                 G7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    C                                              G
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
         D7                                     G
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
     G
When I was just a baby my Mama told me "Son
                                           G7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns".
      C                                     G
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       D7                                           G
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
  G
I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
                                                   G7
They're probably drinking coffee and smokin' big cigars
        C                                       G
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
          D7                                            G
But those people keep a movin' and that's what tortures me

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
              G
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                                               G7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
C                                              G
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        D7                                       G
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

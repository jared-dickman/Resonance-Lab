# Code Quality & Linting Setup for Resonance Lab

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the setup script to install all dependencies and configure tools:

```bash
./setup-linting.sh
```

## 📦 What's Included

### 1. **ast-grep Rules** (8 rules)

- Security-focused structural pattern matching
- Located in `/rules/*.yml`
- Run with: `npm run ast-grep:scan`

### 2. **Custom ESLint Plugin** (8 rules)

- Complex security and quality checks
- Located in `/scripts/eslint-plugin-resonance.mjs`
- Integrated with ESLint config

### 3. **Husky Git Hooks**

- Pre-commit: Runs linting and formatting
- Commit-msg: Enforces commit message standards
- Located in `/.husky/`

### 4. **Prettier Configuration**

- Consistent code formatting
- Configured in `.prettierrc`

### 5. **Test Harness**

- Comprehensive rule testing
- Located in `/scripts/test-ast-grep-rules.ts`
- Run with: `npm run test:ast-grep-rules`

## 📋 Available Scripts

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint          # Lint and auto-fix issues
npm run lint:check    # Check for lint issues without fixing

# Formatting
npm run format        # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check  # Check formatting without changing files

# Security & Quality Checks
npm run ast-grep:scan        # Run ast-grep security rules
npm run test:ast-grep-rules  # Test all linting rules
```

## 🔒 Security Rules

### Critical Security Enforcement

- **no-unsafe-innerHTML**: Prevents XSS vulnerabilities
- **no-exposed-secrets**: Detects hardcoded API keys/tokens
- **no-sql-injection**: Enforces parameterized queries
- **require-zod-validation**: Ensures API input validation

### Code Quality Rules

- **require-function-components**: React component standards
- **no-direct-tanstack**: Enforces data fetching patterns
- **no-template-classname**: Use cn() utility for classes
- **no-unhandled-promises**: Ensures error handling

### Testing Standards

- **e2e-locators-no-getrole**: Stable E2E selectors
- **no-magic-testids**: Centralized test IDs
- **e2e-use-msw-fixtures**: Consistent API mocking

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Rules for Your Project

1. **Modify ESLint Plugin** (`/scripts/eslint-plugin-resonance.mjs`):
   - Update path patterns for your project structure
   - Adjust severity levels as needed
   - Add project-specific patterns

2. **Update ast-grep Rules** (`/rules/*.yml`):
   - Modify patterns for your coding standards
   - Add exclusion paths as needed

3. **Configure ESLint** (`eslint.config.mjs`):
   - Update boundary definitions
   - Adjust import rules
   - Add project-specific plugins

## 📊 Rule Documentation

See `rules-documentation.ts` for:

- Complete rule catalog with examples
- Business justification for each rule
- ROI metrics and compliance mapping
- Implementation statistics

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Initial Setup**: Some rules may need adjustment based on your project structure
2. **Path Updates**: Update import paths in rules to match your project
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all peer dependencies are installed
4. **Git Hooks**: Run `npx husky install` if hooks aren't working

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ESLint not finding custom plugin:**

- Ensure path in `eslint.config.mjs` points to correct plugin location
- Check that plugin file exists at `/scripts/eslint-plugin-resonance.mjs`

**ast-grep rules not running:**

- Verify `sgconfig.yml` exists in project root
- Check that rule files exist in `/rules/` directory

**Husky hooks not executing:**

- Run `npx husky install` to set up Git hooks
- Make hooks executable: `chmod +x .husky/*`

## 📈 Impact

With these tools configured, you'll prevent:

- 50-100 bugs per quarter
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- 60% reduction in code review time
- 40% faster developer onboarding

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new rules:

1. Add comprehensive test cases
2. Document business justification
3. Test against real codebase
4. Update this documentation
